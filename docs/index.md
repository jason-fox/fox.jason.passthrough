<h1>Pass Through Plugin for DITA-OT</h1>

This is an abstract base DITA-OT Plug-in to enable files to bypass DITA-OT pre-processing and be copied directly over
into the processing directory. It is designed to be extended.

The plugin consists of a no-op file reader and an Antlib library. It offers two extension-points for further processing.
